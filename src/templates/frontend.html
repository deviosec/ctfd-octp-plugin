        <h2>Frontend Information</h2>
        This page is intended for novice users, who do not have their own kali box, or generally hacking tools installed on their own laptop.
        Here each user can claim a frontend which will be a preconfigured Kali Linux box, which will have all the tools needed to complete the challenges (or they can be installed if not).
        But keep in mind, this might be slow and slugish because it is a remote machine, where the latency might be high!
        But if that is not a problem for you, then go ahead! Use our frontends!
        {% if not frontend.frontendId %}
            You have not claimed a frontend yet, click here to get a frontend!<br/>
            <a href='#' id='claimFrontend'>Claim Frontend</a>!
        {% else %}
            Your frontend is located at: <b>{{ frontend.frontendIp }}</b>, congrats! <br/>
            You can connect to it using <b>vnc://{{ frontend.frontendIp }}</b>, or click
            this link to connect using the browser, 
            <a target="_blank" href="/octp/novnc?host={{ frontend.frontendIp }}&port=5900">connect using your browser</a>.
